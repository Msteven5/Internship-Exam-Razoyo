# Internship-Exam-Razoyo

## Description

This web application is a fun proof of concept for my abilities in frontend. It is also an assessment given to me by Razoyo.

## Installation

The node packages used in this application to allow it to function properly and therefore must be installed before attempting to use this code on your own are all provided by the package.json. After cloning this repository, simply use the command npm i after making sure Node is installed. 

## Usage

This application can be used to see a sample list of cars, their price, MPG, seats, year, make, and model. It utilizes an API provided by Razoyo for the exam.

Here's a screenshot of the application once all packages are installed and it is functioning properly:
